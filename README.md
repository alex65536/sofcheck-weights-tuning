# Weights tuning for SoFCheck

This repository contains notebooks and datasets to tune the evaulation weights in
[SoFCheck chess engine][1].

The engine uses the tuning method described in [this post][2] (in Russian). It is similar to
[Texel's tuning method][3].

## Datasets

Datasets are prepared in SoFCheck's dataset format, as generated by [BattleField][4]. To extract
CSV with coefficients from these datasets, you need to build SoFCheck and use the `make_datasets`
utility from it. All the data is `bzip2`-compressed to take less disk space.

The datasets are as follows:

- `stockfish20k.txt.bzip2` contains 20000 games played by [Stockfish][5] against itself on short
time control (~100ms).

More datasets may be available later.

## Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks, which we used to train SoFCheck, are also lacated in this repository. Note that
the results may be not completely reproducible because of randomness.
